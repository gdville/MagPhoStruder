# MagPhoStruder
Open Source design for extruding Magnesia-Phosphate cement.

Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) has been much studied and is well understood as a structural material. Unfortunately, it is not very hermetic, it leaches, it takes weeks to cure in moist, temperate (15–25°C) conditions, and it typically requires steel reinforcement for any flexural or tensile strength. Alternative cements based on alkaline magnesia (MgO) and acid phosphate (PO4) chemistry are also possible. Magnesium phosphate ceramics (MPC) have been in use since ancient times and have recently been making something of a comeback as “green cement”. Formulations are commercially available as Grancrete, Ceramicrete, Bindan Monopatch, and other products. In addition to some of the advantages listed in Table 1, MPC can cure at relatively cold temperatures, almost to freezing, and cure in minutes[3].

Indeed, this fast cure time is one of the characteristics thus far limiting widespread adoption of this material- the slurry pot life is unforgiving and large volumes can lose strength due to water cavitation caused by the fast exothermic reactions. This has caused problems in the construction industry with manually poured foundation methods. However, these characteristics could become much more advantageous when done with additive printing techniques, particularly considering that the MPC chemistry utilizes covalent bonds that adhere rather than merely encapsulating (as OPC does). Progressively applying thin layers of fast curing MPC offers to provide a potentially strong and versatile construction method.
